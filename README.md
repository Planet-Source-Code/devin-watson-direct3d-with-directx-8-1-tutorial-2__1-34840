## Direct3D with DirectX 8\.1 Tutorial 2


</div>

### Description

This is my second DirectX tutorial program. Once more, everything is heavily commented for easy understanding. I tried to explain not just the how but the why of everything. This example program builds on the previous tutorial, and introduces a few new code snippets, such as how to create and use the D3DFont facility for printing text to the screen, toggling to fullscreen mode in DirectX 8.1, and also using a frame control loop instead of a Timer control. I found that this particular application ran as fast as its C++ counterpart in fullscreen mode and in windowed mode. If you have any problems or questions, please contact me. Please vote!
 
### More Info
 
Make sure you have DirectX 8.1 SDK installed first.
